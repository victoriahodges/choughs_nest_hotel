					<h2>The Cornish chough</h2>	
					<p>The red-billed chough (pronounced 'chuff'), Cornish chough or simply chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), is a member of the crow
					family, one of only two species in the genus Pyrrhocorax the other being the yellow-billed Alpine chough.</p>
					<p>They breed on mountains and coastal cliffs from the western coasts of Ireland and Britain east through southern Europe and
					North Africa.</p>
					<p>These corvids have glossy black plumage, brightly coloured bills, legs and feet. They have long broad wings and are known to
					perform spectacular tumbling, diving and swooping aerobatics, which makes a truly impressive sight.
					</p>
					<p>They emit an excitable, high-pitched "chi-ow" call from which the bird gets its name.</p>

					<h2>Are there any choughs in Lynton &amp; Lynmouth?</h2>
					<p>Sadly, we have found no record of any recent official chough sightings, however conservation work has continued to increase
					their numbers around the South West.
					</p>

					<p>Choughs were formerly resident along the North Devon coast with the last documented breeding record at Lynton in 
					1910<span class="small" style="vertical-align: super;">[1]</span>.</p>

					<p>The chough was once widespread around the coasts of Britain, but had declined since the early nineteenth century, with
					only about 335  breeding pairs<span class="small" style="vertical-align: super;">[2]</span> left, mainly distributed over Cornwall, Wales, the Isle of Man and western Scotland.
					</p>

					<p>A decline in suitable feeding habitats is thought to be the main reason for the loss of the chough from England, 
					with many of the well-grazed pastures that were once common along the coast, ploughed up for arable crops or overgrown with
					scrub<span class="small" style="vertical-align: super;">[3]</span>.
