					<h3>Stunning</h3>
					<p><em>As soon as we walked in we felt as if the worries of the world has been left behind. It felt comfortable and was so clean and welcoming.
						The views are spectacular and waking up to the view of the bay just can't be put into words. Kate and Helen are brilliant. The service from
						Kate front of house and the stunning breakfast from Helen is second to none. Nice touch to be able to take out a slice of cake, scone or fruit.
						Thank you for a great weekend. A return visit is on the cards.</em></p>
					<p class="review-stars gold-text">★★★★★</p>

				</div>
				<div class="review-snippet">
					<h3>A hidden gem</h3>
					<p><em>A beautiful house with heaps of period charm and spectacular views across the bay. 
						Peaceful and comfortable in the manner of a more genteel era, perfectly completed by the warm welcome 
						and attention to detail of our hosts Kate and Helen... for our group of 10 guests it was unanimous that we shall return, a faultless stay.</em></p>
					<p class="review-stars gold-text">★★★★★</p>

				<div class="review-snippet">
					<h3>A welcome break for my wife's birthday in a very caring hotel.</h3>
					<p><em>From the time we arrived we were made very welcome. Our room was excellent with first class facilities and a glorious view. Breakfast and the 
						light evening meals were delicious and the offer of cakes and fruit to take away (even a bag was supplied) was a first for us and much appreciated. 
						Being able to walk straight onto the Valley of the Rocks was an added bonus.</em></p>
					<p class="review-stars gold-text">★★★★★</p>
				</div>
				<div class="review-snippet">
					<h3>An excellent stay</h3>
					<p><em>A lovely few days recapturing memories of our honeymoon at The Chough's Nest in October 1976. We had a very comfortable, spacious room with sea view
						and we couldn't have been looked after any better by Kate and Helen who served an excellent breakfast... 
						and home made light evening meals. The homemade cakes put out at breakfast which were free to take away were much appreciated, especially the Rock Cakes. Thanks for a lovely stay.</em></p>
